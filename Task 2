 -> Why Compiled language ? "More efficient in resources , more control over hardware aspects, like memory management and CPU usage" 
 ->Examples:
 -GO
 -Rust
 -C++ (The C++ language is a standard https://isocpp.org. Unlike say Python, which has a main implementation, C++ has had many impementations over the years. Some have been open such as Clang and GCC.
 -C#
 
   --What are Interpreter languages and their examples ?--
 -> Interpreter language is languages that run line by line , usually it's more slower and takes alot of resources compared to compiled.
 ->Examples:
 -Python
 -PHP
