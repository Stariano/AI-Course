OVERLOADING--> Is a feature in OOP that lets you add the the same name of functions inside the same class.

*Usually the functions have the same name but different methods in them or a different way of writing in them.

Like class car --> Methods ( METER(SPEED METER , METER(RPM METER) ) 

**See a function with the same NAME but different items or properties in them.**

Rules:
1-Functions have a diferent sequence of parameters.
2-Functions have different parameter type.
3-Functions have a different number of parameters.


Note : it's supported in C++ only.
