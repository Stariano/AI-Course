--> 1) It's for code reuse , as it makes it easier to edit in an inherited class than the abstracted class that will make errors as we go on and develop alot of attr.,
functions, etc... 

--> 2) You can achieve the same with a delegation chain : No it will be too mind exhausting as inheritance is easier in that type of stuff...
