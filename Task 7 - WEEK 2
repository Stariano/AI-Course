 Code :
  
DUBLIST = ["Stavros", "Ahmed", "Stavros", "Omar", "Mahmoud", "Stavros" , "Mahmoud" , "Ali"] // Adding values inside a list.
NODUBLIST = list(dict.fromkeys(DUBLIST)) // Making a new list with the name "NODUBLIST" then changing the values of the original list into a DECT. A DECT can't accept same values as keys so i've changed the values into DECT keys tand then reverse it to a list.
print(NODUBLIST) // PRINT the new list
